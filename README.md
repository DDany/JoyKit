Nice to meet you guys. 

I'm an young Objective-C Kit and full of joy. 

Maybe you will say:"Emm... You really look like someone else". Yes, I am learning many things from [Nimbus](http://nimbuskit.info), [Three20](https://github.com/facebook/three20), and many other open source projects.

Now I can do
======

###JoyKitCore

Cocoa SDK extension.


###JoyKitSingletonObject

Base idea to achieve the singleton mode. Every singleton object should subclass it.


###JoyKitTextView

Text view with a placeholder just like UITextField.


###JoyKitAlertActionSheet

Alert & Action sheet support block methods, subclass of UIAlertView/UIActionSheet.


###JoyKitUserDefaults

NSUserDefaults access via properties. Thoughts come from [GVUserDefaults](https://github.com/gangverk/GVUserDefaults).

###JoyKitBadgeView

Flat style badge view based on : [LKBadgeView](https://github.com/lakesoft/LKbadgeView).


###JoyKitBaseViewController

Some helper methods in it.


###JoyKitNavigationController

Customize pop style with drag gesture.


###JoyKitNavigator

Thoughts come from [Three20](https://github.com/facebook/three20)'s TTNavigator, but without URL-Mechanism.


###JoyKitTabBar

Customized tab bar.


###JoyKitTabBarController

Customized tab bar controller with some joyful functions:

*  Lazy-load view controller.
*  Remove view controller programmatically.
*  Customized tab bar with auto-hide function.


###JoyKitWindowView

Window based view.

This view will be shown on top of both current-key-window and status bar. Some useful scenarios as below:

*  Full-screen displayed ads.
*  App introduction.
*  Customized alert view or action sheet.


###JoyKitInfiniteScrollView

Lazy Loading UIScrollView (with infinite page scrolling). It's based on : [DMLazyScrollView](https://github.com/malcommac/DMLazyScrollView).




What's am I learning now?
======

*  Attributed label.
*  Full-screen displayed photo browser.
*  Customized activity view similar to UIActivityViewController.



Statement
======

As I said earlier, I am an pretty young and navie Objective-C API kit. 

####I have disadvantages. I probably make mistakes. Please help me grow. Thanks!
