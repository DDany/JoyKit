JoyKit (Objective-C Kit with joy)
======

Nice to meet you guys. 

I'm an young Objective-C Kit and full of joy. 

Danny made me recently. Maybe you will say:"Emm... You really look like someone else". Yes, I am learning many things from [Nimbus](http://nimbuskit.info), [Three20](https://github.com/facebook/three20), and many other open source projects.

Now I can do
======

**JoyKitCore**

Cocoa SDK extension.


**JoyKitSingletonObject**

Base idea to achieve the singleton mode. Every singleton object should subclass it.


**JoyKitTextView**

Text view with a placeholder just like UITextField.


**JoyKitAlertActionSheet**

Alert & Action sheet support block methods, subclass of UIAlertView/UIActionSheet.


**JoyKitUserDefaults**

NSUserDefaults access via properties. Thoughts come from [GVUserDefaults](https://github.com/gangverk/GVUserDefaults).

**JoyKitBadgeView**

Flat style badge view based on : [LKBadgeView](https://github.com/lakesoft/LKbadgeView).


**JoyKitBaseViewController**

Some helper methods in it.


**JoyKitNavigationController**

Customize pop style with drag gesture.


**JoyKitNavigator**

Thoughts come from [Three20](https://github.com/facebook/three20)'s TTNavigator, but without URL-Mechanism.


**JoyKitTabBar**

Customized tab bar.


**JoyKitTabBarController**

Customized tab bar controller with some joyful functions:
>1. Lazy-load view controller.
>2. Remove view controller programmatically.
>3. Customized tab bar with auto-hide function.


**JoyKitWindowView**

Window based view.

This view will be shown on top of both current-key-window and status bar. Some useful scenarios as below:
>1. Full-screen displayed ads.
>2. App introduction.
>3. Customized alert view or action sheet.


**JoyKitInfiniteScrollView**

Lazy Loading UIScrollView (with infinite page scrolling). It's based on : [DMLazyScrollView](https://github.com/malcommac/DMLazyScrollView).




What's am I learning now?
======

>1. Attributed label.
>2. Full-screen displayed photo browser.
>3. Customized activity view similar to UIActivityViewController.



Statement
======

As I said earlier, I am an pretty young and navie Objective-C API kit. 

I have disadvantages. I probably make mistakes. Please help me grow. Thanks!
